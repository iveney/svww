    excerpt:
      I started woodworking by chance. There was a woodshop near where I work and I’ve always wanted to visit them. Finally, I signed up for their intro class and a few more classes to make cutting boards, boxes, etc., and then I fell in love with it.


      I’ve since purchased numerous tools and started gradually building my shop in my garage. Thanks to the internet, I was able to watch a lot of videos to build up my skill. I felt passionate to work with wood and figured it’ll be cool if I can share my journey.


      Woodworking is a hobby so I am only able to work on it during weekends. I might be able to squeeze some time during weekday nights for painting and finishing as most of the time you are just waiting. It also takes quite some time to design plans, edit, and publish the videos.


      If you have a day time job like me, but still find yourself enjoying woodworking and wanted to learn more, then you are at the right place :) For updates, feel free to follow me here or on one of the social media.
