[Plan](https://svww.weeblysite.com/product/router-table-cart/1)

In this video, I'll show how I build a router table cart for my Bosch RA1181 router table.

I build my shop in my smallish 2-car garage and therefore mobility and compactness are important.
I've already built mobile carts for my table saw and miter saw.
So, building another one for my new router table is straightforward.
I put together a video and plans if you are interested in following through!
