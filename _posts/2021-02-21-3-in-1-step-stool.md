[Plan](https://svww.weeblysite.com/product/3-in-1-step-stool/2)

This step stool set has a big and a small stool. They can be used separately or stacked to become a step stool. When not in use, you can hide the small stool inside the big stool!

I used cherry to build the project. The pieces are jointed by dowels. I used figure 8 fasteners to attach the stool top to the frame to handle wood movements. To finish, I used Watco danish oil and a few coats of spray lacquer.

Inspired by [Fix This Build That's Nesting Step Stool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhn7QXKw1SI).
